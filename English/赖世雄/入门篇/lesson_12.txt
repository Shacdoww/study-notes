ten [tɛn]
pen [pɛn]
very ['vɛri]
only ['onli]
hundred ['hʌndrəd]
change [tʃendʒ]不可数 注意念出 A 的音
these [ðiz; ðɪs]
water [ˈwɔtɚ; ˈwɑtɚ]
cost  [kɔst]
expensive [ɪk'spɛnsɪv]
anything  ['ɛnɪ'θɪŋ]
cheaper [tʃipə]

how much dose that pen cost?
= how much is that pen?

表示某物要花多少钱 
how much (money) dose/do 单数复数物品 cost?
= how much (money) is/are  单数/复数物品?

how much (money) does that shirt cost?
= how much does that shirt cost?
= how much (money) is that shirt?
= how much is that shirt?

how much (money) do these pencil cost?
= how much (money) are these pencils?

a. 以上句型中的much为代名词, how much 理论上
是由 how much money 省略而来的, (money 通常
不说出来以免造成累赘), 此时的much则是形容词
专用们来修饰不可数名词.
how much money do you have?
此时是不能用many的. 
以纸为例, 不可数名词 
a paper, two papers这种说法是不正确的.
这种不可数名词如果想表达数量, 可以使用不可数
名词的单位 如 a piece of paper, two piece of paper
a glasses of water, two glasses of water

b. 可数名词要使用many修饰
how many books do you have?
这里不可使用much
there are five books in the bag. 
袋子里有5本书.
有生命的东西有通常用hava
而无生命的东西有使用there be...

so so 马马虎虎

c. 上列句型中使用cost 不可用人做主语
John costs ten dollars.
表示John值10美元. 用10美元可以买到John.

the dress costs twenty dollars.
这里costs 可以不加s表示过去时, 更好点的用法.
this hat costs her thirty dollars.

人的花费应该使用spend

that's very expensive.
a. expensive 形容词, 表示非常昂贵 通常用来
形容物品, 不可以用来形容价格(price)
the car is expensive.
b. 形容价格可以用 high/low 来表示
the price of the house is high.
the house is expensive.

Do you have anything cheaper?
a. 上列句子中的anything 表示'任何事物'的意思,
与something, nothing 均为代名词可用来代替事情
或物品. anything使用于疑问句 否定句, 而something
则是使用于肯定句中, nothing本身具有否定意义因此
不可以再与not no 等否定词并用, 以免造成双重否定.
使用这3个词注意, 通常形容词放在名词前, 但修饰这
3个代词这放于其后.
do you have anything important to tell me?
i don't have anything important to tell you.
i have something good for you.
the poor man does't have anything to ear.
= the poor man has nothing to eat.

b. 上列句子中的cheaper 比较便宜的是形容词cheap
的比较级
一般而言 原级有双音节以上的单词变成比较级的方法是
在其前面加more 
expensive - more expensive
important - more important
beautiful - more beautiful 

而原级是单音节则是在其字尾加er
cheap - cheaper 
tall - taller
cold - colder

原级以辅音结尾的单音节 形容词变比较级
则双写辅音字母+er
hot - hotter
fat - fatter

do you have change for a hundred
= do you have change for a hundred dollars?
change 不可数
how much change do you need?
而不是
how many changes do you need?

- how much change do you have?
= how much do you have in change?
- i have change for ten dollars.
= i have ten dollars in change.

-how much cash do you have?
= how much do you have in cash?
- i have cash for one hundred.
= i have one hundred in case.

ok. here's the money. 
好， 给你
here is/ here's + 单数名词
here are / here're + 复数名词
译为 ...给你 或者 ...在这儿

-that will be fifty dollars please.
-here's a hundred.
-here is the money.
-here are the books.
但是更为常用的是 
here you are.
here you go.

-can i have a look at that shirt?
-here you are.
=here you go.

表示"你要的东西在这里"
"那去吧" "在这儿"

spend costs
man
queen
