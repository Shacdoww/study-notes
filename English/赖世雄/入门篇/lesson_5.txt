感叹句
有两种, 一种what引导, 一种how引导,
what 与 how 均可翻译成 "多么的..." 或 "好..."

a. 以what引导的感叹句
what + 名词 + 主语 + be 动词！
(1) 先造句一个含有 "主语 + be + 名词" 的句子
this is a good movie.
John is a filial son.
Mary and John are good students.
(2) 在句首放What再将名词放在What后
what a good movie this is.
what a filial son Jhon is.
what good students Mary and John are!
(3)实际使用经常将主语 + be省略
what a good movie!
what a filial son!
what good students!

b. 以how引导

How + 形容词 + 主语 + be ！ 多么...呀！
(1) 先造句一个含有 "主语 + be + 形容词"
john is nice.
she is beautiful.
the children are diligent.
(2)在句首放How再将形容词放在How后
how nice john is!
how beautiful she is!
how diligent children are!
(3)实际使用经常将主语 + be省略
how nice!
how beautiful!
how diligent!
